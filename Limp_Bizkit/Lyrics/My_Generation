If only we could fly, Limp Bizkit style. John Otto, take 'em to the Matthew's bridge.
Can ya feel it? My g-g-generation, get up. My g-g-generation, are you ready?
Do you know where you are? Welcome to the jungle punk, take a look around.
It's Limp Bizkit fuckin' up your town, we download in the shockwave.

For all the ladies in the cave, to get your groove on,
And maybe your the one who flew over the cuckoo's nest.
Well, guess who's next. Generation x, generation strange.
Sun don't even shine through a window pane.

So go ahead and talk shit, talk shit about me, and go ahead and talk shit. About my g-g-generation!

We don't, don't give a fuck, and we won't ever give a fuck un, til you,
You give a fuck about me and my generation.

Hey kid, take my advice, ya don't want to step into a big pile of shit.
The captain is drunk, your world is titanic.
Floatin' on the funk, so get your groove on, and maybe I am just a little fucked up.
Life's just a little fucked up.
Generation x, generation strange. Sun don't even shine through the window pane.

So go ahead and talk shit, talk shit about me, and go ahead and talk shit about my g-g-generation.

We don't, don't give a fuck, and we won't ever give a fuck un, til you,
You give a fuck about me and my generation.

We don't, don't give a fuck, and we won't ever give a fuck un, til you,
You give a fuck about me and my generation.

Who gets the blame, you get the blame and I get the blame.
Who gets the blame, you get the blame and I get the blame, but do you think we can fly?
Do you think we can fly?
Do you think we can fly? Well I do, I do... FLY!

DJ Lethal, bring it on. Ooh yea, come on!

So go ahead and talk shit, talk shit about me and go ahead and talk shit about my g-g-generation.

We don't, don't give a fuck, and we won't ever give a fuck un, til you,
You give a fuck about me and my generation.

We don't, don't give a fuck, and we won't ever give a fuck un, til you,
You give a fuck about me and my generation.

Oh yeah
