Why is everybody always picking on me?
Does anybody really know a thing about me?
One of these days we'll be in the same place
In the same place punk, at the very same time
And when it takes place
And you want to talk shit
Then step your ass up, and say it right to my face

You'll get knocked the fuck out
Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash

I ain't believing all the shit you been talking 'bout me
Don't even know me, and still you're talking shit about me
One of these days I'm gonna catch you in the act
In the act, red handed
Caught up in the act, punk
And that'll be the day, the one and only day
Then step your ass up, and say it right to my face

You'll get knocked the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash

Shhh

So where you at?
Where you been?
I'm sure of the shit (I) you was in
'Cause this world

Is really small
Can we all get along?
Can we all get along?
And where you at?

Where you been?
I'm sure of the shit (I) you was in
'Cause this world
Is really small

Can we all get along?
Can we all get along?

I'm upset at our people
Who permanently rape us
We're talking
We try to ignore them

Ignore them until they keep talking
They think that they're building an empire
Without us
We've got the torch now

We've got the fire to burn this motherfucker down
Town, town
Burn this motherfucker down
Town, town

Burn this motherfucker now
Down, down
Burn this motherfucker now
Down, down

Burn this motherfucker

You'll get knocked the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash
Knocked straight the fuck out
'Cause your mouth's writing checks that your ass can't cash

Motherfucker!
Just shut your fuckin' mouth!
Bring it on Lethal
Come on
